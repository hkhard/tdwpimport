## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Backend:** PHP 8.0+, WordPress 6.0+
- **Database:** MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.2+
- **Frontend:** React 18+ for admin UI
- **Real-time:** WordPress Heartbeat API + optional WebSocket
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Build:** Webpack 5

### Database Tables (New)
- `wp_poker_tournament_templates` - Reusable tournament configs
- `wp_poker_blind_schedules` - Blind level definitions
- `wp_poker_prize_structures` - Prize configurations
- `wp_poker_tournament_live_state` - Real-time tournament state
- `wp_poker_tables` - Table definitions
- `wp_poker_table_assignments` - Player seating
- `wp_poker_player_state` - Current player status/chips
- `wp_poker_transactions` - All financial transactions
- `wp_poker_player_movements` - Table movement history
- `wp_poker_tournament_events` - Audit/event log

### API Structure
RESTful API following WordPress conventions:
- `/wp-json/poker-tournament/v1/tournaments/*` - Tournament CRUD
- `/wp-json/poker-tournament/v1/tournaments/:id/clock` - Clock control
- `/wp-json/poker-tournament/v1/tournaments/:id/players/*` - Player ops
- `/wp-json/poker-tournament/v1/tournaments/:id/tables/*` - Table management
- `/wp-json/poker-tournament/v1/templates/*` - Template management

### State Management
- **Persistent:** MySQL tables for core data
- **Ephemeral:** WordPress transients for session data
- **Real-time:** Heartbeat API (15s polling) or WebSocket for large events

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Real-time state management in WordPress
- **Mitigation:** Heartbeat API proven for autosave; WebSocket layer for 100+ player events

**Risk:** Data loss during live tournaments
- **Mitigation:** Auto-save every 30s; transaction log for replay; recovery mode

**Risk:** Performance with large tournaments (500+ players)
- **Mitigation:** Caching strategy; async processing; background jobs; load testing

**Risk:** TD3 feature parity expectations
- **Mitigation:** Clear documentation of differences; .tdt import/export compatibility

**Risk:** WordPress plugin conflicts
- **Mitigation:** Extensive testing; proper namespacing; isolated frontend app

### Business Risks

**Risk:** Low conversion from free to paid
- **Mitigation:** Generous free tier with clear upgrade path; trial period

**Risk:** Competing with free Tournament Director alternatives
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize cloud advantages: accessibility, updates, integration

**Risk:** Support burden
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive documentation; video tutorials; community forum
