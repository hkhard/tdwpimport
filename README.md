## 📊 Technical Details

### TDT File Format
The parser handles Tournament Director's JavaScript serialization format:
- JavaScript constructor calls (`new Tournament({...})`)
- Nested object structures with Map.from() syntax
- Millisecond timestamps for precise timing
- Complex mathematical formulas for points calculation

### Points Formula
Tournament Director points calculation:
```
Points = 10*(sqrt(n)/sqrt(r))*(1+log(avgBC+0.25)) + (numberofHits * 10)
```
Where:
- `n` = total players
- `r` = finish position
- `avgBC` = average buy-in amount
- `numberofHits` = eliminations

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
.tdt File Upload → Validation → Parsing → Data Processing
→ Database Storage → Template Rendering → Frontend Display
```

### Data Model
- **Tournaments**: Individual tournament results
- **Series**: Tournament series (UUID-based linking)
- **Seasons**: Time-based tournament groupings
- **Players**: Comprehensive player statistics
