# Version 2.4.18 - Tournament Director Variable Mapping Fix

## Release Date
October 16, 2025

## Type
**Production Fix** - Resolves formula calculation failures caused by variable name mismatch

## Summary

Version 2.4.18 fixes the formula calculation failures that caused formulas to fall back to the simple n-r+1 calculation. The root cause was a mismatch between the variable names used by our parser (snake_case PHP keys like `total_buyins_amount`) and the variable names expected by Tournament Director formulas (camelCase TD specification names like `totalBuyinsAmount`). This version implements proper variable name mapping and adds a comprehensive variable reference modal to help users understand available variables.

## The Problem

### Symptom: Formula Fallback to n-r+1

Log output showed:
```
⚠️ WARNING: Complete Formula Attempted: assign("nSafe", max(n, 1));assign("buyinsSafe", max(buyins, 1));...
⚠️ WARNING: Fallback Points: 14 (using n-r+1 formula)
```

**Root Cause**: Variable Name Mismatch

Our parser extracts data with snake_case PHP keys:
- `total_players`
- `total_buyins_amount`
- `hits`
- `winnings`

Tournament Director formulas expect camelCase TD specification names:
- `buyins`
- `totalBuyinsAmount`
- `numberOfHits`
- `prizeWinnings`

Additionally, TD formulas use variable aliases:
- `n` for `buyins`
- `r` for `rank`
- `nh` for `numberOfHits`
- `pw` for `prizeWinnings`

Without proper mapping, formulas couldn't find the variables they needed, causing calculation to fail and fall back to the simple n-r+1 formula.

## The Solution

### 1. Variable Mapping Table

Created authoritative mapping based on official TD specification (`Points for Playing Formula.html`):

```php
private $td_variable_map = array(
    // Tournament Information Variables
    'total_players' => 'buyins',              // n, numberofplayers
    'finish_position' => 'rank',              // r
    'hits' => 'numberOfHits',                 // nh
    'total_money' => 'pot',                   // prizepool, pp

    // Financial Variables
    'total_buyins_amount' => 'totalBuyinsAmount',
    'total_rebuys_amount' => 'totalRebuysAmount',
    'total_addons_amount' => 'totalAddOnsAmount',
    'buyin_amount' => 'defaultBuyinFee',

    // Player Information Variables
    'winnings' => 'prizeWinnings',            // pw
    'number_of_rebuys' => 'numberOfRebuys',   // nr, rebuys
    'number_of_addons' => 'numberOfAddOns',   // na, addons

    // ... 30+ mappings total
);
```

### 2. Rewritten prepare_variables() Method

Completely rewrote the method to:

1. **Map internal keys to TD variable names** using the mapping table
2. **Add all TD variable aliases** from specification (n, r, nh, pw, etc.)
3. **Type cast values** based on TD specification (integers for counts, floats for currency)
4. **Set safe defaults** for critical variables (buyins defaults to 1, rank defaults to 1)
5. **Compute helper variables** (monies = total money in, avgBC = average buy-in cost)

### 3. Variable Reference Modal

Added comprehensive 4-tab modal accessible from formula editor:

**Tab 1: Tournament Variables**
- Shows all TD tournament variables (buyins, rank, numberOfHits, etc.)
- Displays aliases, types, and descriptions
- Based on official TD specification

**Tab 2: Player Variables**
- Shows all TD player variables (prizeWinnings, numberOfRebuys, etc.)
- Complete metadata for each variable
- Type information and usage examples

**Tab 3: Variable Mapping**
- Shows our internal keys → TD variables → aliases
- Example: `total_players` → `buyins` → `(n, numberofplayers)`
- Perfect for debugging formula issues

**Tab 4: Functions**
- Shows all 43+ available mathematical functions
- Examples: abs(), sqrt(), pow(), log(), max(), min(), if()
- Usage examples for each function

### 4. Enhanced Error Reporting

Added comprehensive logging for formula calculation failures:
- Logs complete formula and execution context
- Logs all provided variables with their values
- Logs raw input data from parser
- Logs processed formula before execution
- Returns debug_info array with full exception trace

This enables precise diagnosis when formulas fail.

### Variable Mapping Flow

```
Parser Output (snake_case)
    ↓
Internal Keys
    ↓
$td_variable_map Lookup

### Computed Helper Variables

```php
// Total money into tournament
$variables['monies'] = $variables['totalBuyinsAmount']
                     + $variables['totalRebuysAmount']
                     + $variables['totalAddOnsAmount'];

// Average buy-in cost
$variables['avgBC'] = $variables['buyins'] > 0
    ? $variables['monies'] / $variables['buyins']
    : 0;
```

## Installation Instructions

### Standard Update

1. **Backup your site** (always recommended)

2. **Deactivate current version**
   - WordPress Admin → Plugins
   - Deactivate "Poker Tournament Import"

3. **Delete old version**
   - Delete the deactivated plugin (ensures clean install)

4. **Install v2.4.18**
   - Upload `poker-tournament-import-v2.4.18.zip`
   - Activate the plugin

5. **Test formula calculation**
   - Re-import a tournament (or recalculate points for existing tournament)
   - Check import log - should show proper points calculation
   - NO fallback warnings should appear

### Verify Success

**Before v2.4.18:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Complete Formula Attempted: assign("nSafe", max(n, 1));...
⚠️ WARNING: Fallback Points: 14 (using n-r+1 formula)
```

**After v2.4.18:**
```
✓ Points calculated successfully using PokerStars formula
1st place: 267.4 points
2nd place: 189.2 points
3rd place: 154.1 points
```

### Using Variable Reference Modal

1. Go to **WordPress Admin → Settings → Formula Manager**
2. Create or edit a formula
3. Click **"Show Variable Reference"** button
4. Browse the 4 tabs:
   - **Tournament Variables**: Available tournament data variables
   - **Player Variables**: Available player data variables
   - **Variable Mapping**: How our data maps to TD variables
   - **Functions**: All available mathematical functions

## What This Fixes

✅ **Formula calculation failures** - Variables now properly mapped from parser output to TD specification
✅ **Missing variable aliases** - All TD aliases (n, r, nh, pw, etc.) now supported
✅ **Fallback to n-r+1** - Formulas now execute correctly with proper variable names
✅ **Variable discovery** - Modal shows all available variables and their mapping
✅ **Formula debugging** - Enhanced error reporting shows exactly what went wrong

## What This Doesn't Change

- AST parser architecture (unchanged)
- Formula evaluation engine (unchanged)
- Data extraction from .tdt files (unchanged)
- Player extraction logic (unchanged from v2.4.17)
- Any other plugin functionality

## Backward Compatibility

Fully backward compatible with:
- All .tdt file formats supported by v2.4.17
- All existing formulas (both default and custom)
- All WordPress themes and plugins
- PHP 8.0+ (same as v2.4.17)

## Migration Path

### From Any Previous Version
Direct upgrade to v2.4.18 - no special migration steps required

### After Upgrade
- Existing tournaments retain their calculated points
- Re-import tournaments if you want to recalculate points with corrected formula
- Custom formulas should work correctly if they use TD variable names
- If custom formulas use our internal variable names, they may need updates

## Known Issues

None at this time.

## Support

If you experience issues after installing v2.4.18:

1. **Check WordPress debug log** for error messages
2. **Use Variable Reference modal** to verify variable names in your formula
3. **Check import log** for formula calculation warnings
4. **Share debug output** - Include full import log in support request

## Credits

This fix was made possible by:
- User reporting formula fallback warnings in import logs
- Analysis of TD specification variable naming standards
- Identification of snake_case vs camelCase mismatch
