# Version 2.3.20 - Template & Fatal Error Fixes - Installation Instructions

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Version 2.3.20 resolves critical template issues that were causing deprecation warnings and fatal errors when viewing player and tournament pages.

### The Problems Fixed

1. **Fatal Error in Tournament Pages** - Fatal error: "Using $this when not in object context" at line 255 of single-tournament.php
2. **Theme Dependency Warnings** - Deprecation warning: "File Theme without header.php is deprecated since version 3.0.0" on both player and tournament pages
3. **Edit Links Investigation** - Confirmed that Edit/View links are not present in Players tab (only "Profile" button exists)

### The Solutions

#### 1. **Fixed Fatal Error** (single-tournament.php:255)
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect function call using `$this->get_tournament_winner_info()` in template context
   - **Fix**: Changed to `get_tournament_winner_info()` (standalone function call)
   - The function is defined as a standalone function at line 21, not a class method

#### 2. **Removed Theme Dependencies** (single-player.php & single-tournament.php)
   - **Root Cause**: Templates called `get_header()` and `get_footer()` which require theme files
   - **Fix**: Replaced with self-contained HTML structure
   - Templates now include their own `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
   - Maintained WordPress hooks (`wp_head()`, `wp_body_open()`, `wp_footer()`) for plugin compatibility

#### 3. **Edit Links Status**
   - Investigation confirmed that Edit/View buttons were already removed from Players tab in v2.3.19
   - JavaScript code only shows "Profile" button (admin.js:1473-1475)
   - Edit/View buttons only appear in Tournaments and Series tabs (not Players)

## 📦 Installation Files

- **Install Package:** `poker-tournament-import-v2.3.20.zip`
- **Location:** `/Users/hkh/dev/tdwpimport/wordpress-plugin/`

## 🔧 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Complete Plugin Removal
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins
2. **Deactivate** the Poker Tournament Import plugin
3. **Delete** the plugin completely
4. Using FTP or file manager, navigate to `/wp-content/plugins/`
5. **Delete ALL folders** that start with `poker-tournament-import`:
   - `poker-tournament-import`
   - `poker-tournament-import-v2.3.19`
   - Any other version folders

### Step 2: Clear All Caches

**WordPress Object Cache:**
- If using a caching plugin (W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache, etc.), clear ALL caches
- Go to each caching plugin and use "Clear All Caches" or "Purge All"

**Browser Cache:**
- Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac)
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Clear from "All time"

**Hard Refresh:**
- Windows: Ctrl+Shift+F5 or Ctrl+F5
- Mac: Cmd+Shift+R

### Step 3: Install Version 2.3.20
1. Upload `poker-tournament-import-v2.3.20.zip`
2. Install through WordPress Admin → Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
3. **Activate** the plugin

### Step 4: Flush Rewrite Rules
**IMPORTANT**: After activation, permalinks need to be flushed for custom post type templates to work

1. Go to WordPress Admin → Settings → Permalinks
2. Click "Save Changes" (no need to change anything, just save)
3. This flushes WordPress rewrite rules and registers custom post type URLs

### Step 5: Verification

1. Go to WordPress Admin → Poker Tournament → Dashboard
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the **Console** tab
4. Look for this message at the top:
   ```
   ========================================
   ADMIN.JS VERSION 2.3.20 LOADED
   Expected pokerImport structure: {dashboardNonce, refreshNonce, ajaxUrl, adminUrl, messages}
   Actual pokerImport: {dashboardNonce: "...", refreshNonce: "...", ...}
   ========================================
   ```

### Step 6: Test Player/Tournament Pages

**Test Player Pages:**
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Players tab
2. Click on any player name
3. Should navigate to player profile page (NOT 404)
4. **Should NOT see deprecation warnings** in browser console or page
5. Player profile should display correctly with statistics, tournament history, etc.

**Test Tournament Pages:**
1. Navigate to Dashboard → Tournaments tab
2. Click on any tournament name
3. Should navigate to tournament detail page (NOT 404)
4. **Should NOT see deprecation warnings or fatal errors**
5. Tournament page should display results, winner info, etc.

### Step 7: Verification Checklist

✅ Console shows "ADMIN.JS VERSION 2.3.20 LOADED"
✅ pokerImport object shows: `{dashboardNonce: "...", refreshNonce: "...", ajaxUrl: "...", adminUrl: "...", messages: {...}}`
✅ Dashboard Players tab shows NO "Edit" or "View" buttons (only "Profile" button)
✅ Player pages load without deprecation warnings
✅ Player pages load without fatal errors
✅ Tournament pages load without deprecation warnings

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Player/Tournament Pages Still Show Deprecation Warnings

**Verify Template Files Were Updated:**
```bash
# Via SSH or FTP, check the first few lines of templates
head -20 /wp-content/plugins/poker-tournament-import/templates/single-player.php
```
Should show:
```php
?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>
<head>
```

### If Tournament Pages Still Show Fatal Error

**Check Line 255 in single-tournament.php:**
Should be: `$winner_info = get_tournament_winner_info(get_the_ID());`
NOT: `$winner_info = $this->get_tournament_winner_info(get_the_ID());`

**Verify via SSH:**
```bash
grep -n "get_tournament_winner_info" /wp-content/plugins/poker-tournament-import/templates/single-tournament.php
```

### If Pages Still Give 404

**Check Permalinks:**
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Settings → Permalinks
2. Note your current setting (e.g., "Post name")
3. Change to a different setting temporarily
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Change back to your original setting
6. Click "Save Changes" again
7. Try player/tournament links again

**Check Rewrite Rules:**
1. Deactivate plugin
2. Reactivate plugin (this triggers flush_rewrite_rules in activation hook)
3. Test links again

### Nuclear Option

If still not working:
1. Delete ALL plugin files from server
2. Delete ALL browser data for your site
3. Close ALL browser windows
4. Restart browser
5. Clear server-side caches (Redis, Memcached, Varnish, etc.)
6. Reinstall from v2.3.20 zip
7. Flush permalinks (Settings → Permalinks → Save)

## 📝 Technical Details

- Line 255: Changed `$this->get_tournament_winner_info(get_the_ID())` to `get_tournament_winner_info(get_the_ID())`

- Line 3: Version comment updated to 2.3.20
- Line 8: Console log updated to show version 2.3.20

### Why These Fixes Work

#### 1. Fatal Error Fix
- **Root Cause**: Template files are not class methods, they're standalone PHP files
- **Fix**: Called `get_tournament_winner_info()` as a standalone function (defined at line 21)
- Templates cannot use `$this->` syntax as they're not within a class context

#### 2. Template Dependency Fix
- **Root Cause**: `get_header()` and `get_footer()` require theme to have header.php/footer.php
- **Fix**: Templates now provide their own complete HTML structure
- Maintains WordPress hooks (`wp_head()`, `wp_body_open()`, `wp_footer()`) for plugin compatibility
- Ensures templates work regardless of theme capabilities

#### 3. Template Structure
```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>
<head>
    <meta charset="<?php bloginfo('charset'); ?>">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title><?php wp_title('|', true, 'right'); ?> <?php bloginfo('name'); ?></title>
    <?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>
<body <?php body_class(); ?>>
<?php wp_body_open(); ?>
<!-- Template content -->
<?php wp_footer(); ?>
</body>
</html>
```
