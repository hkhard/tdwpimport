# Version 2.4.19 - Formula Variable Name Typo Fix

## Release Date
October 16, 2025

## Type
**CRITICAL BUGFIX** - Resolves formula calculation failures caused by case sensitivity typo

## Summary

Version 2.4.19 fixes a critical case sensitivity typo in the default PokerStars formula that caused all formula calculations to fail with "Insufficient operands for operator +" error. The formula referenced `totalBuyInsAmount` (capital I) while v2.4.18's variable mapping correctly provided `totalBuyinsAmount` (lowercase i). This simple one-character typo prevented the formula from executing and caused fallback to the basic n-r+1 calculation.

## The Problem

### Symptom: Formula Evaluation Error

Log output showed:
```
⚠️ WARNING: Formula evaluation failed: Evaluation error: Insufficient operands for operator +
⚠️ WARNING: Fallback Points: 14 (using n-r+1 formula)
```

**Root Cause**: Case Sensitivity Typo in Formula String

The default PokerStars formula used:
```php
'assign("monies", totalBuyInsAmount + totalRebuysAmount + totalAddOnsAmount)',
                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                   Capital 'I' - WRONG
```

The v2.4.18 variable mapping correctly provided:
```php
$variables['totalBuyinsAmount'] = 1300;
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
            Lowercase 'i' - CORRECT
```

**Impact**:
- Formula attempted to use undefined variable `totalBuyInsAmount`
- RPN stack evaluator tried to add `undefined + 0 + 0`
- Stack underflow caused "Insufficient operands" error
- All formula calculations fell back to simple n-r+1
- v2.4.18's perfect variable mapping was rendered useless by typo in formula string

## The Solution

### Simple One-Character Fix

Changed capital 'I' to lowercase 'i' in two locations:

**1. class-formula-validator.php (line 419)**
```php
// BEFORE (WRONG)
'assign("monies", totalBuyInsAmount + totalRebuysAmount + totalAddOnsAmount)',

// AFTER (CORRECT)
'assign("monies", totalBuyinsAmount + totalRebuysAmount + totalAddOnsAmount)',
                  ^        lowercase 'i'
```

**2. class-parser.php (line 1119)**
```php
// BEFORE (WRONG)
'assign("monies", totalBuyInsAmount + totalRebuysAmount + totalAddOnsAmount)',

// AFTER (CORRECT)
'assign("monies", totalBuyinsAmount + totalRebuysAmount + totalAddOnsAmount)',
                  ^        lowercase 'i'
```

### Why Two Locations?

- **class-formula-validator.php**: Contains default PokerStars formula used when no custom formula is set
- **class-parser.php**: Contains hardcoded fallback formula used when all other formula sources fail

Both needed correction to ensure consistent behavior.

## What Changed

### Files Modified

**1. `/includes/class-formula-validator.php`**
- **Line 419**: Fixed `totalBuyInsAmount` → `totalBuyinsAmount` in default formula

**2. `/includes/class-parser.php`**
- **Line 1119**: Fixed `totalBuyInsAmount` → `totalBuyinsAmount` in fallback formula

**3. `/poker-tournament-import.php`**
- **Line 6**: Updated Version from 2.4.18 to 2.4.19
- **Line 23**: Updated VERSION constant to 2.4.19

**4. `/readme.txt`**
- **Line 6**: Updated stable tag to 2.4.19
- **Lines 78-94**: Added v2.4.19 changelog entry
- **Lines 529-530**: Added v2.4.19 upgrade notice

## Installation Instructions

### Standard Update

1. **Backup your site** (always recommended)

2. **Deactivate current version**
   - WordPress Admin → Plugins
   - Deactivate "Poker Tournament Import"

3. **Delete old version**
   - Delete the deactivated plugin (ensures clean install)

4. **Install v2.4.19**
   - Upload `poker-tournament-import-v2.4.19.zip`
   - Activate the plugin

5. **Test formula calculation**
   - Re-import a tournament (or recalculate points for existing tournament)
   - Check import log - should show proper points calculation
   - NO evaluation errors should appear

### Verify Success

**Before v2.4.19:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Formula evaluation failed: Evaluation error: Insufficient operands for operator +
⚠️ WARNING: Fallback Points: 14 (using n-r+1 formula)
```

**After v2.4.19:**
```
✓ Points calculated successfully using PokerStars formula
✓ Formula executed without errors
1st place: 267.4 points
2nd place: 189.2 points
3rd place: 154.1 points
```

## What This Fixes

✅ **Formula calculation failures** - Variable name now matches what v2.4.18 provides
✅ **"Insufficient operands for operator +" error** - RPN evaluator can now find all variables
✅ **Fallback to n-r+1** - PokerStars formula executes correctly without errors
✅ **v2.4.18 variable mapping** - Now works as intended with corrected formula string

## What This Doesn't Change

- v2.4.18 variable mapping logic (unchanged - it was already correct)
- AST parser architecture (unchanged)
- Formula evaluation engine (unchanged)
- Data extraction from .tdt files (unchanged)
- Player extraction logic (unchanged)
- Any other plugin functionality

## Backward Compatibility

Fully backward compatible with:
- All .tdt file formats supported by v2.4.18
- All existing formulas (both default and custom)
- All WordPress themes and plugins
- PHP 8.0+ (same as v2.4.18)

## Migration Path

### From v2.4.18
Direct upgrade to v2.4.19 - essential for all v2.4.18 users experiencing formula failures

### From Any Previous Version
Direct upgrade to v2.4.19 - includes all fixes from v2.4.18 plus this critical typo fix

### After Upgrade
- Existing tournaments retain their calculated points
- Re-import tournaments if you want to recalculate points with corrected formula
- Custom formulas using correct variable names will continue to work

## Known Issues

None at this time.

## Technical Details

### Case Sensitivity in PHP Variables

PHP variables are case-sensitive:
- `$totalBuyinsAmount` (lowercase 'i') ≠ `$totalBuyInsAmount` (capital 'I')
- These are treated as completely different variables
- Referencing undefined variable in formula causes stack underflow in RPN evaluator

### RPN Stack Evaluation

Formula evaluator uses Reverse Polish Notation stack-based evaluation:
1. Push operands onto stack
2. Pop operands for operators
3. If operand is undefined, stack underflow occurs
4. Error: "Insufficient operands for operator +"

### v2.4.18 Variable Mapping Was Correct

The v2.4.18 release correctly implemented:
```php
$variables['totalBuyinsAmount'] = $total_buyins_amount;  // lowercase 'i' ✓
```

The bug was NOT in the mapping, but in the formula string itself:
```php
'assign("monies", totalBuyInsAmount + ...)',  // capital 'I' ✗
```

## Support

If you experience issues after installing v2.4.19:

1. **Check WordPress debug log** for error messages
2. **Check import log** for formula calculation warnings
3. **Verify formula syntax** - Use Variable Reference modal to check variable names
4. **Share debug output** - Include full import log in support request

## Credits

This fix was made possible by:
- User reporting "Insufficient operands for operator +" error in import logs
- Analysis of RPN stack evaluation failure
- Grep search revealing typo in formula string (capital I vs lowercase i)
- Recognition that v2.4.18 variable mapping was already correct
