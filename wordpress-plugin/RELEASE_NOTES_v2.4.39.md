# Poker Tournament Import Plugin - Version 2.4.39 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 16, 2025
**Criticality:** CRITICAL BUGFIX - Immediate upgrade required for all v2.4.38 users
**Type:** Prize Extraction Bug Fix

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED

### Prize Extraction Failure: GamePrizes Wrapper Not Handled

**Version 2.4.38 attempted to fix winnings display but failed** because prizes were not being extracted from the .tdt file at all. This version fixes the root cause of the prize extraction failure.

#### The Problem

Modern .tdt files wrap prize data in a **GamePrizes constructor** that was not being unwrapped:

```
Prizes: new GamePrizes({Prizes: [new GamePrize({...}), ...]})
```

The domain mapper's `extract_prizes()` method expected:

```
Prizes: [new GamePrize({...}), ...]
```

#### The Flow of the Bug

1. **User's .tdt file contains:** `Prizes: new GamePrizes({Prizes: [new GamePrize({Description: "1st Place", CalculatedAmount: 2200, Recipient: 1}), ...]})`
2. **Domain mapper extracts:** `$prizes_node = $entries['Prizes']` ‚Üí Gets the GamePrizes constructor
3. **Type check fails:** `if (!$this->is_type($prizes_node, 'Array'))` ‚Üí TRUE (it's a GamePrizes constructor, not an Array)
4. **Debug log shows:** `"Poker Import - WARNING: Prizes node is not an Array type"`
5. **Method returns:** Empty prizes array `return $prizes;`
6. **Parser receives:** 0 prizes to distribute
7. **Debug log shows:** `"Poker Import - Total prizes to distribute: 0"`
8. **Winnings calculation:** No prizes to match with players ‚Üí all winnings = $0.00
9. **ROI table shows:** total_invested = $200, total_winnings = $0.00, net_profit = -$200

#### The Impact

- **All prize winners** showed $0.00 winnings
- **ROI table** showed only negative values (investments) with no prize winnings
- **Top players panel** showed incorrect net profit (missing prize winnings)
- **Dashboard statistics** showed no prize distribution data

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S FIXED IN v2.4.39

### Code Fix

**File:** `includes/class-tdt-domain-mapper.php`
**Method:** `extract_prizes()`
**Lines:** 544-579

**Before (WRONG):**
```php
private function extract_prizes($entries) {
    $prizes = array();

    if (!isset($entries['Prizes'])) {
        return $prizes;
    }

    $prizes_node = $entries['Prizes'];

    // THIS CHECK FAILS - prizes_node is GamePrizes constructor, not Array!
    if (!$this->is_type($prizes_node, 'Array')) {
        error_log("Poker Import - WARNING: Prizes node is not an Array type");
        return $prizes; // EXITS HERE WITH EMPTY ARRAY
    }

    // ... rest never executes ...
}
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```php
private function extract_prizes($entries) {
    $prizes = array();

    if (!isset($entries['Prizes'])) {
        error_log("Poker Import - WARNING: No Prizes field found");
        return $prizes;
    }

    $prizes_wrapper = $entries['Prizes'];

    // v2.4.39: Check if wrapped in GamePrizes constructor (modern format)
    if ($this->is_new_with_ctor($prizes_wrapper, 'GamePrizes')) {
        error_log("Poker Import - Found GamePrizes wrapper, unwrapping...");
        // Extract the inner GamePrizes object
        $game_prizes_obj = $this->expect_object($prizes_wrapper['arg']);
        $gp_entries = $game_prizes_obj['entries'];

        // Get the inner Prizes field
        if (!isset($gp_entries['Prizes'])) {
            error_log("Poker Import - WARNING: No Prizes field inside GamePrizes wrapper");
            return $prizes;
        }

        $prizes_node = $gp_entries['Prizes'];
    } else {
        // Direct array format (older files)
        $prizes_node = $prizes_wrapper;
    }

    // Now check if the unwrapped node is an Array
    if (!$this->is_type($prizes_node, 'Array')) {
        error_log("Poker Import - WARNING: Prizes node is not an Array type");
        return $prizes;
    }

    // ... rest of extraction continues ...
}
```

### What This Fixes

- **Modern .tdt files** now extract prizes correctly
- **Prize winners** show actual prize amounts instead of $0.00
- **ROI calculations** include prize winnings in total_winnings
- **Top players panel** displays accurate net profit values
- **Backward compatible** with older files that use direct array format

---

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### The Pattern Used

This fix applies the **same unwrapping pattern** that was proven successful for GamePlayers in version 2.4.14:

**GamePlayers unwrapping (v2.4.14, lines 248-263):**
```php
if ($this->is_new_with_ctor($players_wrapper, 'GamePlayers')) {
    $game_players_obj = $this->expect_object($players_wrapper['arg']);
    $gp_entries = $game_players_obj['entries'];
    if (!isset($gp_entries['Players'])) {
        return $players;
    }
    $players_node = $gp_entries['Players'];
}
```

**GamePrizes unwrapping (v2.4.39, lines 555-572):**
```php
if ($this->is_new_with_ctor($prizes_wrapper, 'GamePrizes')) {
    $game_prizes_obj = $this->expect_object($prizes_wrapper['arg']);
    $gp_entries = $game_prizes_obj['entries'];
    if (!isset($gp_entries['Prizes'])) {
        return $prizes;
    }
    $prizes_node = $gp_entries['Prizes'];
}
```

### Supported Formats

**Modern Format (Tournament Director 3.7+):**
```
Prizes: new GamePrizes({
    Prizes: [
        new GamePrize({Description: "1st Place", CalculatedAmount: 2200, Recipient: 1}),
        new GamePrize({Description: "2nd Place", CalculatedAmount: 1300, Recipient: 2}),
        new GamePrize({Description: "3rd Place", CalculatedAmount: 800, Recipient: 3})
    ]
})
```

**Legacy Format (Older Tournament Director versions):**
```
Prizes: [
    new GamePrize({Description: "1st Place", CalculatedAmount: 2200, Recipient: 1}),
    new GamePrize({Description: "2nd Place", CalculatedAmount: 1300, Recipient: 2}),
    new GamePrize({Description: "3rd Place", CalculatedAmount: 800, Recipient: 3})
]
```

Both formats are now supported!

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Still seeing $0.00 winnings after upgrade

**Cause:** You upgraded the plugin but didn't re-import the tournaments.

**Solution:** Follow Step 4 above to re-import your .tdt files.

---

### Issue: Debug log still shows "Prizes node is not an Array type"

**Cause:** Your .tdt file might have a different prize structure.

**Solution:**
1. Check your error log for the new debug message: `"Poker Import - Found GamePrizes wrapper, unwrapping..."`
2. If you don't see this message, share your .tdt file structure for further analysis

---

### Issue: Some prizes extract but not all

**Cause:** Possible data integrity issue in the .tdt file.

**Solution:**
1. Check error log for individual prize extraction messages
2. Verify each GamePrize has required fields: `Recipient`, `CalculatedAmount`
3. Share specific error messages for troubleshooting

## üìä VERSION HISTORY CONTEXT

This bug fix chain:
